![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](/.config/sway/linux-screenshot.png)
hey. these are my personal dotfiles for my linux system, version 2! 
they're probably buggy on your computer right now, but i will be making them better over time.
here's some highlights.
## neovim
* lazy loading via [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
* code completion and snippets via [coq_nvim](https://github.com/ms-jpq/coq_nvim), with language server installation using [nvim-lsp-installer](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer)
* fuzzy finding via [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
* file tree using [chadtree](https://github.com/ms-jpq/chadtree)
* [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim), [dashboard-nvim](https://github.com/glepnir/dashboard-nvim), and [bufferline.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/bufferline.nvim) to make the editor look pretty
## other
* custom catppuccin css on eww and waybar
* zsh config that uses zinit turbo and powerlevel10k for good speeds
* sway config that's mostly unmodified except for some things
* uses kitty and fira code nerd font for icons and ligatures
